Updates to my USACO file doesn/t seem to be registering
I realized after break that the way to solve commit problems was to clone the directory again as opposed to trying to trace unconnected bits. Unable to commit during break
Still confused conceptually about 10Deque.
Made some progress on LinkedList but still trying to work out how to solve certain parts.
Created brainstorm outlines and things to clarify. After break, hope to meet up with my ARISTA tutor at Dojo to get more help.
Order of what to work on:
1)Linked List
2)Deque
3)Quick(Select and Sort)
4)MergeSort
5)USACOSilver
6)MazeSolver
